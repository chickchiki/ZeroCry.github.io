            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> The progressing decades have witnessed vital transmogrification in the
                civilizations. Malnutrition, illiteracy , destitution and inequalities subdue the scientific and
                technological advancements .Global threats like COVID-19 attempt to reverse progress in fighting global
                poverty.
                “Poverty is the parent of revolution and crime.”
                ~Aristotle
                The catastrophic growth of poverty and chronic hunger highlights that its reason is the paucity of
                access to the resources. Inadequate retrievement of clean freshwater and dearth of nutritious meals
                degrade physical and mental health, originate water-borne illnesses, increase medicinal costs , thus
                making the impoverished families more vulnerable. Lack of availability of jobs and exploitation of the
                traditional livelihoods like farming, fishing and many more ( due to climate changes, conflicts and
                overpopulation ) cause monetary drawbacks. Sometimes poor infrastructure and absence of Internet isolate
                the communities and make them incapable to fetch the fundamental provisions. Travelling to distant
                locations for trading, schooling and earning hike travel expenses and cause time and energy drain.
                Researches interpret education and literacy are the sole revolutionising tools to extirpate social and
                economic inequalities. Few to no schools in some regions, incompetence to pay education fees and lack of
                awareness prohibit education from marginalising gender ,caste and race discriminations . History unveils
                how wars and internal discords have demolished financial stability, communal infrastructures and caused
                major deaths. Collective reasons induce absolute and relative poverty, causing economic downfall, child
                labour and women’s sexual exploitation. Ineffective governments fail to prevent these miserable families
                from backsliding into further meagre conditions.
                ZeroCRY attempts to personally approach each and every poverty-stricken nooks of the society and lend a
                helping hand to them to uprise and progress.ZeroCRY targets equal financial thrift amongst the
                citizens.Its time to eradicate poverty and promote equality.This led us to create ZeroCRY.</p>
